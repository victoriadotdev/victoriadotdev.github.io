When I first pour in my hot drink, I know it takes 10-15 minutes to cool to a drinkable temperature.\nIf I walk away and start coding or writing, I know I\u0026rsquo;ll end up forgetting about my drink long enough for it to get cold.\nInstead, I always take that time to do some yoga or bodyweight exercises. Those short bursts of activity get my blood moving and help to refresh my mind.\nI also don\u0026rsquo;t lose track of time with a quick exercise the way I do when I\u0026rsquo;m in coding flow, so by the time 10-15 minutes pass, I feel ready to stop.\nIf I make a hot drink 2-4 times a day (nearly 100% of my days) that\u0026rsquo;s 30 minutes to an hour of exercise in total, without even thinking about it.

So I searched my blog (site:https://victoria.dev ia writer working copy) and found my post from 20 months ago explaining the set up.\nA remote sync solution for iOS and Linux: Git and Working Copy\nI followed my own instructions but one of the steps didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. Either I missed something the first time, or the process changed since I wrote it up.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s ok! I had a head start on my research already thanks to what I wrote, and in a few minutes I found the new answer. I decided to update the post and in so doing I realized it\u0026rsquo;s the second time I\u0026rsquo;ve updated it to add something new! It‚Äôs like past me leaving helpful tips for future me, months or years ago.\nMany people read my blog, and I‚Äôm flattered by the feedback I receive. I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôm able to help so many other people, but I also don‚Äôt write it for other people primarily.\nI write down the things I do and what I learn from doing them because it‚Äôs like having a second, more-perfect brain. My meat-brain will forget the details, but my disk-brain can retain its accuracy indefinitely.\nI often get questions like, ‚Äúhow do I choose a theme for my blog?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat platform should I use?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat popular language/framework/topic should I focus on?‚Äù My answer is: don‚Äôt start with that. Start with you.\nChoose whatever publishing option is easiest for you right now, then start by writing for yourself. Write about what interests you. Try something new, even if it seems rudimentary, and write in-depth about what you learn. (One of my most popular posts is about iteration in Python. When I first wrote it, I considered myself a complete beginner.)\nWrite for yourself by explaining what you‚Äôre doing, as if it were past-you teaching future-you ‚Äî because it is. You will be your first reader, and the first judge of how useful your blog can be. Seek to impress yourself!\nMake it a habit, and I think the rest will follow.\n","date":"2020-12-07T10:20:54Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"33954","uri":"https://victoria.dev/feedcat/33954/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"To understand the world, travel.\nTo understand yourself, stay home.\n","date":"2020-12-02T13:26:00Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"33619","uri":"https://victoria.dev/feedcat/33619/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, you found the secret room. üéâ\nThere are cookies. üç™üç™üç™\n","date":"2020-11-28T14:30:00Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"33342","uri":"https://victoria.dev/feedcat/33342/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"\u0026ldquo;You cannot push anyone up a ladder unless he be willing to climb a little himself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Andrew Carnegie\n","date":"2020-11-25T13:26:00Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"33048","uri":"https://victoria.dev/feedcat/33048/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"I occasionally revisit previous blog posts and update them with things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned (and why not?
