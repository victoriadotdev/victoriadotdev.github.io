Signal had so many new users sign up that it overwhelmed their existing infrastructure and lead to a 24-hour-ish outage. The small team responded impressively quickly, especially given that a 4,200% spike in new users was utterly implausible before it ocurred.</description></item><item><title>So you're the family tech support</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/so-youre-the-family-tech-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:42:24 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/so-youre-the-family-tech-support/</guid><description>🎄🌟 Happy holidays! 🌟🎄

Picking the type of password you need can seem like an arbitrary choice. After all, WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 all have mostly the same letters in them. A password is a password, so what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?
About 60 seconds to billions of years, as it turns out.
All Wi-Fi encryption is not created equal.

A lesser-known purpose is to protect your privacy right in your own home, from your own internet service provider (ISP).
A set of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules entitled &amp;ldquo;Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services&amp;rdquo; were unfortunately struck down in 2017. These rules would have prevented ISPs from using and selling your sensitive personal data, such as precise geographic location, health and financial information, web browsing history, and even the content of the messages you send.</description></item><item><title>Your cybersecurity starter pack</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/your-cybersecurity-starter-pack/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 04:30:12 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/your-cybersecurity-starter-pack/</guid><description>Readers of my blog typically know more about technology and cybersecurity than most people.

If you want to send data confidentially over the Internet, you might have a few more considerations to cover.
TLS, or Transport Layer Security, refers to a protocol. &amp;ldquo;Protocol&amp;rdquo; is a word that means, &amp;ldquo;the way we&amp;rsquo;ve agreed to do things around here,&amp;rdquo; more or less.</description></item><item><title>Look mom, I'm a GitHub Action Hero</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/look-mom-im-a-github-action-hero/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 09:06:33 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/look-mom-im-a-github-action-hero/</guid><description>GitHub recently interviewed me for their blog editorial entitled GitHub Action Hero: Victoria Drake.

It&amp;rsquo;s far more fun to draw the tire swing, front porch, and swimming pool than to worry about how a ten-thousand-gallon bucket of water stays suspended in midair. With too much attention spent on fun and flashy features, foundations suffer.
Of course, spending undue hours building a back end like Fort Knox may not be necessary for your application, either.</description></item><item><title>Outsourcing security with 1Password, Authy, and Privacy.com</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/outsourcing-security-with-1password-authy-and-privacy.com/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 08:12:32 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/outsourcing-security-with-1password-authy-and-privacy.com/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve already got enough to deal with without worrying about our cybersecurity. When humans are busy and under stress, we tend to get lax in less-obviously-pressing areas, like the integrity of our online accounts. These areas only become an obvious problem when it&amp;rsquo;s too late for prevention.
Cybersecurity can be fiddly and time-consuming. You might need to reset forgotten passwords, transfer multifactor authentication (MFA) codes to different devices, or deal with the fallout of compromised payment details in the event one of your accounts is still breached.</description></item><item><title>Breaking bottlenecks 🍾</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/breaking-bottlenecks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 12:50:29 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/breaking-bottlenecks/</guid><description>I recently gave a lecture on the benefits of building non-blocking processes.

Both a sophisticated social engineering attack or grammatically-lacking email phishing scam can cause real damage. No one who communicates over the Internet is immune.
Like proper hand washing and getting a flu shot, good habits can lower your risk of inadvertently allowing cybergerms to spread. Since the new year is an inspiring time for beginning new habits, I offer a few suggestions for ways to help protect yourself and those around you.</description></item><item><title>Secure web forms for the front-end developer</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/secure-web-forms-for-the-front-end-developer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:27:31 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/secure-web-forms-for-the-front-end-developer/</guid><description>While cybersecurity is often thought of in terms of databases and architecture, much of a strong security posture relies on elements in the domain of the front-end developer. For certain potentially devastating vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), a well-considered user interface is the first line of defense.
Here are a few areas of focus for front-end developers who want to help fight the good fight.

With the introduction of standard streams and specifically standard output, programs gained a way to talk to each other using plain text streams; humanizing and displaying stdout is another matter.

Systems that interact with the public, like companies, educational institutions, and public services, are most susceptible. While delivery methods for ransomware vary from the physical realm to communication via social sites and email, all methods only require one person to make one mistake in order for ransomware to proliferate.
Ransomware, as you may have heard, is a malicious program that encrypts your files, rendering them unreadable and useless to you.</description></item><item><title>Personal cybersecurity posture with too many pop culture references</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/personal-cybersecurity-posture-with-too-many-pop-culture-references/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 08:30:12 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/personal-cybersecurity-posture-with-too-many-pop-culture-references/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Zaphod&amp;rsquo;s just this guy, you know?&amp;rdquo;
