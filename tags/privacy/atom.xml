Signal had so many new users sign up that it overwhelmed their existing infrastructure and lead to <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350118809860886528">a 24-hour-ish outage</a>. The small team responded impressively quickly, especially given that a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/whatsapp-facebook-data-signal-download-telegram-encrypted-messaging-2021-1">4,200% spike</a> in new users was utterly implausible before it ocurred.</p>
<p>The downside of so many people moving onto this fantastic application is that it caused a brief outage. If you rely solely on a certain application for your communications, brief outages can be debilitating. Even when it seems implausible that your favorite chat, email, or website service could just &ndash; <em>poof</em> &ndash; vanish overnight, recent events have proved it isn&rsquo;t impossible.</p>
<p>Have a backup plan. Have several. Here&rsquo;s how you can improve your digital resiliency for things like websites, messaging, and email.</p>
<h2 id="messaging">Messaging</h2>
<p>I recommend Signal because it is open source, end-to-end encrypted, cross-platform, and offers text, voice, video, and group chat. It&rsquo;s usually very reliable; however, strange things can happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to set up a backup plan ahead of any service outages with the people you communicate with the most. Have an agreement for a secondary method of messaging &ndash; ideally another end-to-end encrypted service. Avoid falling back on insecure communications like SMS and social media messaging. Here&rsquo;s a short list for you to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wire.com/">Wire for teams</a> or <a href="https://wire.com/en/products/personal-secure-messenger/">Wire Personal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://getsession.org/">Session</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re particularly technically inclined, you can <a href="/blog/create-a-self-hosted-chat-service-with-your-own-matrix-server/">set up your own self-hosted chat service with Matrix</a>.</p>
<p>Having a go-to plan B can help bring peace of mind and ensure you&rsquo;re still able to communicate when strange things happen.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-contacts">Cloud contacts</h2>
<p>Do you know the phone numbers of your closest contacts? While memorizing them might not be practical, storing them solely online is an unnecessary risk. Most services allow you to export your contacts to vCard or CSV format.</p>
<p>I recommend keeping your contacts locally on your device whenever you can. This ensures you still know how to contact people if your cloud provider is unavailable, or if you don&rsquo;t have Internet access.</p>
<p>Full analog redundancy is also possible here. Remember that paper stuff? Write down the phone numbers of your most important contacts so you can access them if your devices run out of battery or otherwise can&rsquo;t turn on (drop your phone much?).</p>
<h2 id="local-email-synchronization">Local email synchronization</h2>
<p>If your email service exists solely online, there&rsquo;s a big email-shaped hole in your life. If you can&rsquo;t log in to your email for any reason &ndash; an outage on their end, a billing error, or your Internet is down &ndash; you&rsquo;ll have no way to access your messages for however long your exile lasts. If you think about all the things you do via email in a day, I think the appropriate reaction to not having local copies is 🤦.</p>
<p>Download an open source email client like <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a>. Follow <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/thunderbird/download-install-and-migration">instructions to install Thunderbird</a> and set it up with your existing online email service. Your online service provider may have a help document that shows you how to set up Thunderbird.</p>
<p>You can maximize your privacy by <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/thunderbird-telemetry">turning off Thunderbird&rsquo;s telemetry</a>.</p>
<p>To ensure that Thunderbird downloads your email messages and stores them locally on your machine:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the &ldquo;hamburger&rdquo; overflow menu and go to <strong>Account Settings</strong></li>
<li>Choose <strong>Synchronization &amp; Storage</strong> in the sidebar</li>
<li>Ensure that under <strong>Message Synchronizing,</strong> the checkbox for <strong>Keep messages in all folders for this account on this computer</strong> is checked.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may need to visit each of your folders in order to trigger the initial download.</p>
<p>Some other settings you may want to update:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Composition &amp; Addressing</strong> and uncheck the box next to <strong>Compose messages in HTML format</strong> to send plaintext emails instead.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Return Receipts</strong> choose <strong>Global Preferences.</strong> Select the radio button for <strong>Never send a return receipt.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to start using Thunderbird for all your email tasks. Just make sure you open it up regularly so that your messages sync and download to your machine.</p>
<h2 id="websites">Websites</h2>
<p>I strongly believe you should have <a href="/blog/make-your-own-independent-website/">your own independent website</a> for reasons that go beyond redundancy. To truly make your site resilient, it&rsquo;s important to have your own domain.</p>
<p>If you know that my website is at the address <code>victoria.dev</code>, for example, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether I&rsquo;m hosting it on GitHub Pages, AWS, Wordpress, or from a server in my basement. If my hosting provider becomes unavailable, my website won&rsquo;t go down with it. Getting back up and running would be as simple as updating my DNS configuration to point to a new host.</p>
<p>Price is hardly an excuse, either. You can buy a domain for <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100268310-14326263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less than a cup of coffee</a>
 with my Namecheap affiliate link (thanks!). Namecheap also handles <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/">your DNS settings</a>, so it&rsquo;s a one-stop shop.</p>
<p>With your own domain, you can build resiliency for your email address as well. Learn how to set up your custom domain with your email provider. If you need to switch providers in the future, your email address ports to the new service with you. Here are a few quick links for providers I&rsquo;d recommend:</p>

The <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/">specification</a> is production-ready and <a href="https://matrix.org/bridges/">bridges</a> to tons of silo products like Slack, Gitter, Telegram, Discord, and even Facebook Messenger. This lets you use Matrix to link together disjoint communities in one place, or create an alternative communication method that works with, but is independent of, communication silos.</p>
<p>You can create your own self-hosted Matrix chat for as little as $3.50 USD per month on an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/">AWS Lightsail</a> instance. Your homeserver can federate with other Matrix servers, giving you a reliable and fault-tolerant means of communication.</p>
<p>Matrix is most widely installed via its <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Synapse</a> homeserver implementation written in Python 3. Dendrite, its second-generation homeserver implementation written in Go, is currently released in beta. Dendrite will provide more memory efficiency and reliability out-of-the-box, making it an excellent choice for running on a virtual instance.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to set up your own homeserver on AWS Lightsail with Dendrite. You can also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">contribute to Dendrite today</a>.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-lightsail-instance">Create a Lightsail instance</h2>
<p>Spin up a new Lightsail instance on AWS with Debian as your operating system. It&rsquo;s a good idea to create a new per-instance key for use with SSH. You can do this by with the SSH key pair manager on the instance creation page. Don&rsquo;t forget to download your private key and <code>.gitignore</code> your secrets.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Create Instance.</strong> Wait for the status of your instance to change from <strong>Pending</strong> to <strong>Running</strong>, then click its name to see further information. You&rsquo;ll need the Public IP address.</p>
<p>To enable people including yourself to connect to the instance, go to the Networking tab and add a firewall rule for HTTPS. This will open <code>443</code> so you can connect over IPv4. You can also do this for IPv6.</p>
<h2 id="connect-dns">Connect DNS</h2>
<p>Give your instance a catchier address by <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/ds70r09608OQPPRVXSQPOQSRVVVVX" target="_top">buying a domain at Namecheap</a>
 and setting up DNS records.</p>
<ol>
<li>On your domain management page in the <strong>Nameservers</strong> section, choose <strong>Namecheap BasicDNS</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Advanced DNS</strong> tab, click <strong>Add New Record</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add an <code>A Record</code> to your Lightsail Public IP. You can use a subdomain if you want one, for example,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> <code>A Record</code></li>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> <code>matrix</code></li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> <code>13.59.251.229</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This points <code>matrix.example.org</code> to your Lightsail instance.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-your-matrix-homeserver">Set up your Matrix homeserver</h2>
<p>Change permissions on the private key you downloaded:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">chmod <span class="m">600</span> &lt;path/to/key&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Then <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-ssh-using-terminal">SSH to your Public IP</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">ssh -i &lt;path/to/key&gt; admin@&lt;public ip&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Welcome to your instance! You can make it more interesting by downloading some packages you&rsquo;ll need for Dendrite. It&rsquo;s a good idea ot use <code>apt</code> for this, but first you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you&rsquo;re getting the latest stuff.</p>
<p>Change your <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList">sources list</a> in order to get the newest version of Go:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre></div><p>Delete everything except these two lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span class="nx">deb</span> <span class="nx">http</span>:<span class="sr">//</span><span class="nx">cdn</span><span class="p">-</span><span class="nx">aws</span>.<span class="nx">deb</span>.<span class="nx">debian</span>.<span class="nx">org</span>/<span class="nx">debian</span> <span class="nx">buster</span> <span class="nx">main</span><span class="err">

</span></code></pre></div><p>Run <code>sudo apt dist-upgrade</code>. If you&rsquo;re asked about modified configuration files, choose the option to &ldquo;keep the local version currently installed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once the upgrade is finished, restart your instance with <code>sudo shutdown -r now</code>.</p>
<p>Go make some coffee, then SSH back in. Get the packages you&rsquo;ll need with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install -y git golang nginx python3-certbot-nginx

<h2 id="get-dendrite">Get Dendrite</h2>
<p>Clone <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a> and follow the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite#get-started">README instructions to get started</a>. You&rsquo;ll need to choose whether you want your Matrix instance to be federating. For simplicity, here&rsquo;s how to set up a non-federating deployment to start:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite
<span class="nb">cd</span> dendrite
./build.sh

<span class="c1"># Generate a Matrix signing key for federation (required)</span>
./bin/generate-keys --private-key matrix_key.pem

<span class="c1"># Generate a self-signed certificate (optional, but a valid TLS certificate is normally</span>
<span class="c1"># needed for Matrix federation/clients to work properly!)</span>
./bin/generate-keys --tls-cert server.crt --tls-key server.key

<span class="c1"># Copy and modify the config file - you&#39;ll need to set a server name and paths to the keys</span>
<span class="c1"># at the very least, along with setting up the database connection strings.</span>
cp dendrite-config.yaml dendrite.yaml
</code></pre></div><h2 id="configure-dendrite">Configure Dendrite</h2>
<p>Modify the configuration file you just copied:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sudo vim dendrite.yaml
</code></pre></div><p>At minimum, set:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>server name</code> to your shiny new domain name, e.g. <code>matrix.example.org</code></li>
<li><code>disable_federation</code> to true or false</li>
<li><code>registration_disabled</code> to true or false</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configure-nginx">Configure nginx</h2>
<p>Get the required packages if you didn&rsquo;t already install them above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sudo apt install nginx python3-certbot-nginx
</code></pre></div><p>Create your site&rsquo;s configuration file under <code>sites-available</code> with:</p>

ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/&lt;sitename&gt; /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/&lt;sitename&gt;
sudo cp default &lt;sitename&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Edit your site configuration. Delete the <code>root</code> and <code>index</code> lines if you don&rsquo;t need them, and input your server name.</p>
<p>Your <code>location</code> block should look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-nginx" data-lang="nginx"><span class="k">location</span> <span class="s">/</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<h2 id="create-self-signed-certificates">Create self-signed certificates</h2>
<p>You can use <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a> to generate self-signed certificates with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>.</p>

<p>Test your configuration and restart nginx with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
</code></pre></div><p>Then start up your Matrix server.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="c1"># Build and run the server:</span>
./bin/dendrite-monolith-server --tls-cert server.crt --tls-key server.key --config dendrite.yaml
</code></pre></div><p>Your Matrix server is up and running at your web address! If you disabled registration in your configuration, you may need to create a user. You can do this by running the included <code>dendrite/bin/createuser</code>.</p>
<p>You can log on to your new homeserver with any <a href="https://matrix.org/clients/">Matrix client</a>, or Matrix-capable applications like <a href="https://www.pidgin.im/plugins/?publisher=all&amp;query=&amp;type=">Pidgin with the Matrix plugin</a>.</p>

<p>If you see: <code>Unable to decrypt: The sender's device has not sent us the keys for this message.</code> you may need to verify a user (sometimes yourself).</p>
<ol>
<li>In your client, open the user&rsquo;s profile. Click the lock icon if there is one, or otherwise look for a way to verify them.</li>
<li>You may be asked to see if some emojis presented to both users match if you&rsquo;re using certain clients like Element.</li>
<li>You can then re-request encryption keys for any sent messages.</li>

<p>For those of you seeing relatives this season, chances are that you’re the designated family tech support. If part of your time home for the holidays is spent on software updates and troubleshooting WiFi, here are a few other quick wins to help boost your family&rsquo;s online privacy and security.</p>
<h2 id="1-set-up-a-vpn">1. Set up a VPN</h2>
<p>Using a VPN is Online Safety 101, but the biggest barrier to effectiveness is not remembering to turn it on. ExpressVPN&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/features/network-lock?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">Network Lock kill switch feature</a> lets you set-it-and-forget-it, making it seamless to add VPN protection to your online activities. I go in-depth on this <a href="/blog/three-rules-for-choosing-a-vpn-that-takes-your-privacy-seriously/">privacy-focused VPN here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-introduce-a-password-manager">2. Introduce a password manager</h2>
<p>If your family member uses the same password everywhere (<code>&lt;petname&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;house number&gt;</code>, same as last year) because passwords are hard to remember, introduce them to their new best friend, <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Help your family get set up with secure passwords they don&rsquo;t have to write down on Post-It notes &ndash; just one master pass(phrase) is all you need.</p>
<p>When choosing a passphrase, avoid using information easily found on social media accounts, like pet names, favorite sports teams, favorite brands, or birthdays.</p>
<h2 id="3-switch-to-duckduckgo">3. Switch to DuckDuckGo</h2>
<p>Help fight the Internet search monopoly by getting your family to use a search engine that respects their privacy. Go to your browser <strong>Settings</strong> and set your <strong>Default Search Engine</strong> (that uses the URL bar) to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>. Break the ice with an instant answer feature, like searching &ldquo;calendar&rdquo; so you can <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Countdown+To+25th+dec+2020&amp;t=canonical&amp;ia=answer">count down to Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>(You might want to search for &ldquo;classic cocktails cheat sheet&rdquo; after all this.)</p>
<h2 id="4-install-a-better-browser-and-blocker">4. Install a better browser and blocker</h2>
<p>While I prefer a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>, setting one up can be complex. Instead, help set up a privacy-preserving browser like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> or a wide-spectrum blocking extension like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">(GitHub source)</a>.</p>
<p>Your family will get faster page load times, less advertisements interrupting articles and videos, and fewer sneaky trackers leaking browsing habits to big tech, all with near-zero maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="be-a-home-for-the-holidays-hero">Be a home-for-the-holidays hero!</h2>
<p>Help improve your family&rsquo;s security posture this holiday season. A little beefed-up cybersecurity may be one of the best gifts you can give!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping it short-and-sweet this week. My annual Christmas post drops on December 24, full of warm fuzzy goodness and a tech tip or two. Thank you for <a href="/">being a subscriber</a> &ndash; stay tuned!</p>

A lesser-known purpose is to protect your privacy right in your own home, from your own internet service provider (ISP).</p>
<p>A set of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules entitled <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/02/2016-28006/protecting-the-privacy-of-customers-of-broadband-and-other-telecommunications-services">&ldquo;Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services&rdquo;</a> were unfortunately <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/34/text">struck down in 2017</a>. These rules would have prevented ISPs from using and selling your sensitive personal data, such as precise geographic location, health and financial information, web browsing history, and even the content of the messages you send.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not comfortable having that data stored anywhere. Handing it over to my ISP makes me even less comfortable, since these treasure troves of sensitive personal data are a frequent and profitable target for ill-intentioned hackers as well.</p>
<p>Your online activities shouldn&rsquo;t be anyone&rsquo;s business, and certainly not in a literal money-making sense. Using a VPN helps to keep your private information where it belongs: between you and the person you&rsquo;re sending it to.</p>
<p>Of course, if you type any flavor of &ldquo;VPN vs VPN&rdquo; into a search you&rsquo;ll get a smorgasbord of comparison blogs and providers vying for your attention. How do you know what makes a VPN &ldquo;good&rdquo;? (Answer: lots of research.)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a regular reader, you know I&rsquo;m big on security and privacy. (If you&rsquo;re not yet, welcome! Hi!) Since I&rsquo;ve built my career in the cybersecurity industry, I take my VPN fairly seriously. Here are the top three things I look for when choosing my own VPN provider:</p>
<ol>
<li>No DNS leaks</li>
<li>A real commitment to privacy, with no logs</li>
<li>Ease of use across all operating systems</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about <a href="/blog/your-cybersecurity-starter-pack/">why a VPN is important</a> and even how to deal with the challenges of DNS leaks when using OpenVPN to set up my own. The response I often get to articles like these includes the question, &ldquo;Which VPN do you use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer is <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">ExpressVPN</a>. Here&rsquo;s how my privacy philosophy got me there, and why these three points matter so much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>TL;DR: ExpressVPN is built on privacy. You can set-it-and-forget-it with <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/coupons?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpnc">three extra months free</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-you-dont-want-a-dns-leak">Why you don&rsquo;t want a DNS leak</h2>
<p>In a previous Linux-flavored adventure, I created <a href="/blog/how-to-set-up-openvpn-on-aws-ec2-and-fix-dns-leaks-on-ubuntu-18.04-lts/">my own VPN using OpenVPN and AWS EC2</a>. While I&rsquo;ve been told my post was helpful, this was definitely not a plug-and-play solution. After reinstalling a new OS, I once failed to follow my own guide to the letter. It took a few months before I discovered I had a DNS leak.</p>
<figure><img src="dns_leak.png"
         alt="A diagram of a DNS leak"/>
</figure>
<p>Using a VPN prevents your ISP from collecting your sensitive personal data, including your web browsing history, but only as long as you don&rsquo;t have a DNS leak. A DNS leak means that your ISP still sees all the URLs that you visit: their servers resolve them for you. This is plenty of information to build a picture of who you are, what your interests might be, any health issues you might have, what you like to spend money on, and much more.</p>
<p>Protocols like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DNS over HTTPS</a> will help, but they rely on co-operation between many entities that is still in its early stages. In the meantime, I want my VPN to do everything it can to avoid using DNS servers that could collect or sell my browsing history.</p>
<p>At time of writing, there&rsquo;s really only one fool-proof solution to ensuring that your browsing records aren&rsquo;t accidentally shared: run your own private DNS server. So <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/features/dns?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">ExpressVPN did just that</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, this only works in my favor when the VPN itself doesn&rsquo;t keep a record of my activities. Which is why&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="a-no-logs-philosophy-matters">A no-logs philosophy matters</h2>
<p>VPN providers do not all value your privacy, and some are no better than your ISP. Many VPN providers, especially free ones, elect to log your personal data and sell it to data brokers and marketers. Using a VPN that does any kind of logging simply transfers the risk from your ISP to the VPN provider.</p>
<p>At a minimum, you want a VPN provider to clearly state a strict no-logs policy. Of course, this still means you&rsquo;ll have to trust that they aren&rsquo;t being cagey with their definition of &ldquo;logs,&rdquo; and still writing your personal data to disk under a pretense.</p>
<p>A more trustworthy solution would be to remove the possibility of writing any personal data to disk in the first place. So <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/features/trustedserver?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">ExpressVPN got rid of the disks</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="ram.png"
         alt="A cartoon of a ram eating logs. Text reads: Hey look, data! Nom. What am I eating again? Eh nvm."/><figcaption>
            <p>Dad joke. I know.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was pretty thrilled to learn about what ExpressVPN calls <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/blog/introducing-trustedserver/?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">TrustedServer</a>, which runs only on random-access memory, or RAM, and not on hard drives. Unlike a disk meant for long-term, fault-tolerant storage, RAM is volatile memory. It requires constant power to operate, which guarantees that all data is lost when the server is rebooted.</p>
<p>While you wouldn&rsquo;t want a laptop that runs entirely on RAM, volatile memory is perfectly suited to an ephemeral, no-logs VPN server. The entire software stack including the OS must be re-installed from a central, signed image each time the server boots. This also means it&rsquo;s always installing the most up-to-date security patches and configuration. That&rsquo;s clever.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/blog/pwc-audits-expressvpn-servers-to-confirm-essential-privacy-protections?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">post goes into more technical detail</a> on TrustedServer, which was independently audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
<p>As a Director of Engineering myself, I have a deep appreciation for a company that builds its technology on its philosophy.</p>
<p>That said, the technology only works if you actually use it.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-vpn-is-one-you-actually-use">The best VPN is one you actually use</h2>
<p>None of what I&rsquo;ve said so far would matter one iota if my chosen VPN was even just a little bit inconvenient to use.</p>
<p>My preferred platforms are Linux and iOS. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of struggles finding all kinds of software that works equally well on just these two. ExpressVPN seems to offer one of the few applications I&rsquo;ve come across that isn&rsquo;t trapped in an ecosystem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/vpn-software?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">dedicated app for every major platform</a>, including even smart TVs and game consoles. Unlike my experiences with other VPNs, <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/vpn-software/vpn-linux?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">ExpressVPN's Linux app</a> just works, out-of-the-box, the way they said it would.</p>
<figure><img src="exvpn-devices.png"
         alt="ExpressVPN on all your devices image"/><figcaption>
            <p>All the devices!</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I especially appreciate the <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/features/network-lock?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">Network Lock kill switch feature</a>, which prevents me from accidentally sending unprotected network traffic when I first open up my laptop and it reconnects to Wi-Fi. It prevents my ISP from seeing anything I do, and only takes a few seconds to reconnect.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN connects fast and then gets out of my way. I haven&rsquo;t noticed any reduced speeds or blocked sites. I gave a lot of thought to choosing my VPN so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to think about it on a day-to-day basis. I use ExpressVPN constantly, and it just works.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-is-more-than-personal">Privacy is more than personal</h2>
<p>When you protect yourself and your family with a VPN, you improve more than your own personal cybersecurity. The less data your ISP can collect, the less they have to lose, sell, or profit from. One day, the risk and cost for ISPs will outweigh the payoff. When you take action to prevent ISPs from scooping up your family&rsquo;s sensitive personal data, everyone&rsquo;s privacy can benefit.</p>
<p>If you found this article helpful, I invite you to help support my work by <a href="https://www.xvinlink.com/order?a_fid=victoria&data1=vpn">signing up for ExpressVPN</a>. It only takes a few minutes (assuming you remember where you left your credit card) and will give you the best possible set-it-and-forget-it privacy protection that I can recommend.</p>

When humans are busy and under stress, we tend to get lax in less-obviously-pressing areas, like the integrity of our online accounts. These areas only become an obvious problem when it&rsquo;s too late for prevention.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity can be fiddly and time-consuming. You might need to reset forgotten passwords, transfer multifactor authentication (MFA) codes to different devices, or deal with the fallout of compromised payment details in the event one of your accounts is still breached.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most of the work necessary to keep up our cybersecurity measures can be outsourced.</p>
<p>Here are three changes you can make to significantly reduce the chances of needing to fiddle with any of these things again.</p>
<h2 id="1password">1Password</h2>
<p><img src="1Password-iOS-FaceID-darkmode.jpg" alt="1Password on an iPhone"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve historically avoided password managers because of an irrational knee-jerk reaction to putting all my eggs in one basket. You know what&rsquo;s great for irrational reactions? Education.</p>
<p>To figure out if putting all my passwords into a password manager is more secure than not using one, I set out to see what some smart people wrote about it.</p>
<p>First, we need to know a thing or two about passwords. Troy Hunt figured out almost a decade ago that <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant/">trying to remember strong passwords doesn&rsquo;t work</a>. In more recent times, Alex Weinert expanded on this in <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984">Your Pa$$word doesn&rsquo;t matter</a>. TL;DR: our brains aren&rsquo;t better at passwords than computers, and please use MFA.</p>
<p>So passwords don&rsquo;t matter, but complicated passwords are still better than memorable and guessable ones. Since I&rsquo;ve next to no hope of remembering a dozen variations of <code>p/q2-q4!</code> (I&rsquo;m not a <a href="https://inbox.vuxu.org/tuhs/CAG=a+rj8VcXjS-ftaj8P2_duLFSUpmNgB4-dYwnTsY_8g5WdEA@mail.gmail.com/">chess player</a>), this is a task I can outsource to <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. I&rsquo;ll still need to remember one, long, complicated master password - 1Password uses this to encrypt my data, so I really can&rsquo;t lose it - but I can handle just one.</p>
<p>Using 1Password specifically has another, decidedly obvious, advantage. I chose 1Password because of their <a href="https://support.1password.com/watchtower/">Watchtower</a> feature. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/have-i-been-pwned-is-now-partnering-with-1password/">Thanks to Troy Hunt&rsquo;s Have I Been Pwned</a>, Watchtower will alert you if any of your passwords show up in a breach so you can change them. Passwords still don&rsquo;t completely work, but this is probably the best band-aid there is.</p>
<p>One last bonus is that using a password manager is a heck of a lot more convenient. I don&rsquo;t need to take a few tries to type in a complicated password. I don&rsquo;t end up spending time resetting passwords I&rsquo;ve forgotten on sites I only rarely use.</p>
<p>When tasked with remembering all their own passwords, people typically create simpler passwords that are easier to remember &ndash; and easier to hack. This occurs most frequently on sites that are considered unimportant. Using 1Password and generated passwords, those sites are now also first-class citizens in the land of strong passwords, instead of being half-abandoned and half-open attack vectors.</p>
<p>So, yes, all my eggs are in one basket. A well-protected, complex, and monitored basket.</p>
<h2 id="authy">Authy</h2>
<p>Okay - so it&rsquo;s more like one-and-a-half baskets. 🤷🏻</p>
<p><img src="Authy2019Logo.png" alt="Authy&rsquo;s logo"></p>
<p><a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>, from the folks over at <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a>, provides a 2FA solution that&rsquo;s more secure than SMS. <a href="https://authy.com/blog/authy-vs-google-authenticator/">Unlike Google Authenticator</a>, you can choose to back up your 2FA codes in case you lose or change your phone. (1Password offers 2FA functionality as well - but, you know, redundancies.)</p>
<p>With Authy, your back up is encrypted with your password, similarly to how 1Password works. This makes it the second password you can&rsquo;t forget, if you don&rsquo;t want to lose access to your codes. If you reset your account, they all go away. I can deal with remembering two passwords; I&rsquo;ll take that trade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried other methods of MFA, including hardware keys, which can make accessing accounts on your phone more complicated than I care to put up with. I find the combination of 1Password and Authy to be the most practical combination of convenience and security that yet exists to my knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="privacycom">Privacy.com</h2>
<p><img src="privacy-ephemeral.png" alt="Screenshot of Privacy card"></p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s one last line of defense you can put in place in the unfortunate event that one of your accounts is still compromised. All the strong passwords and MFA in the world won&rsquo;t help if you open the doors yourself, and scams and phishing are a thing.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s rather impractical to use a different real credit card every place you shop, virtual cards are just a great idea. There&rsquo;s no good reason to spend an afternoon (or more) resetting your payment information on every account just to thwart a misbehaving merchant or patch up a data breach from that online shop for cute salt shakers you made a purchase at last year (just me?).</p>
<p>As a bonus, a <a href="https://blog.privacy.com/create-virtual-cards-with-privacy-and-1password/">partnership between 1Password and Privacy.com</a> lets you easily create virtual credit cards using the 1Password extension.</p>
<p>By setting up a separate virtual card for each merchant, in the event that one of those merchants is compromised, you can simply pause or delete that card. None of your other accounts or actual bank details are caught up in the process. Cards can have time-based limits or be one-off burner numbers, making them ideal for setting up subscriptions.</p>
<p>This is the sort of basic functionality that I hope, one day, becomes more prevalent from banks and credit cards. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll keep using <a href="https://privacy.com/join/Q6V3V">Privacy.com</a>. That&rsquo;s my referral link; if you&rsquo;d like to thank me by using it, we&rsquo;ll both get five bucks as a bonus.</p>
<h2 id="outsource-better-security">Outsource better security</h2>
<p>All together, implementing these changes will probably take up an afternoon, depending on how many accounts you have. It&rsquo;s worth it for the time you&rsquo;d otherwise spend resetting passwords, setting up new devices, or (knock on wood) recovering from compromised banking details. Best of all, you&rsquo;ll have continual protection just running in the background.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></li>
<li><a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://privacy.com/join/Q6V3V">Privacy.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We have the technology. Free up some brain cycles to focus on other things - or simply remove some unnecessary stress from your life by outsourcing the fiddly bits.</p>

Both a sophisticated social engineering attack or grammatically-lacking email phishing scam can cause real damage. No one who communicates over the Internet is immune.</p>
<p>Like proper hand washing and getting a flu shot, good habits can lower your risk of inadvertently allowing cybergerms to spread. Since the new year is an inspiring time for beginning new habits, I offer a few suggestions for ways to help protect yourself and those around you.</p>
<h2 id="1-get-a-follow-up">1. Get a follow-up</h2>
<p>Recognizing a delivery method for cyberattack is getting more difficult. Messages with malicious links do not always come from strangers. They may appear to be routine communications, or seem to originate from someone you know or work with. Attacks use subtle but deeply-engrained cognitive biases to override your common sense. Your natural response ensures you click.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a simple low-tech habit you can use to deter these attacks: before you act, follow-up.</p>
<p>You may get an email from a friend that needs help, or from your boss who&rsquo;s about to get on a plane. It could be as enticing and mysterious as a direct message from an acquaintance who sends a link asking, &ldquo;Lol. Is this you?&rdquo; It takes presence of mind to override the panic these attacks prey on, but the deterrent itself is quick and straightforward. Send a text message, pick up the phone and call, or walk down the hall, and ask, &ldquo;Did you send me this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the message is genuine, there&rsquo;s no harm in a few extra minutes to double check. If it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;ll immediately alert the originating party that they may be compromised, and you may have deterred a cyberattack!</p>
<h2 id="2-use-and-encourage-others-to-use-end-to-end-encrypted-messaging">2. Use, and encourage others to use, end-to-end encrypted messaging</h2>
<p>When individuals in a neighborhood get the flu shot, others in that neighborhood are safer for it. Encryption is similarly beneficial. Encourage your friends, coworkers, and Aunt Matilda to switch to an app like Signal. By doing so, you&rsquo;ll reduce everyone&rsquo;s exposure to more exploitable messaging systems.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you must stop using other methods of communication entirely. Instead, think of it as a hierarchy. Use Signal for important messages that should be trusted, like requests for money or making travel arrangements. Use all other methods of messaging, like SMS or social sites, only for &ldquo;unimportant&rdquo; communications. Now, if requests or links that seem important come to you through your unimportant methods, you&rsquo;ll be all the more likely to second-guess them.</p>
<h2 id="3-dont-put-that-dirty-usb-plug-into-your-">3. Don&rsquo;t put that dirty USB plug into your ***</h2>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t brush your teeth with a toothbrush you found on the sidewalk. Why would you plug in a USB device if you don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s been?! While we might ascribe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_cyberattack_on_United_States">putting a random found USB drive in your computer</a> to a clever exploitation of natural human curiosity, we&rsquo;re no sooner likely to suspect using <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/444267/how-safe-are-public-charging-stations/">a public phone-charging station</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20807854/apple-mac-lightning-cable-hack-mike-grover-mg-omg-cables-defcon-cybersecurity">a USB cable</a> we bought ourselves. Even seemingly-innocuous USB <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-your-usb-device-is-a-security-risk/">peripherals</a> or <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2010/03/08/Energizer-DUO-USB-Battery-Charger-Software-Allows-Remote-System">rechargeable</a> devices can be a risk.</p>
<p>Unlike email and some file-sharing services that scan and filter files before they reach your computer, plugging in via USB is as direct and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/usb-security/">unprotected</a> as connection gets. Once this connection is made, the user doesn&rsquo;t need to do anything else for a whole host of bad things to happen. Through USB connections, problems like malware and ransomware can easily infect your computer or phone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to swear off the convenience of USB connectivity, or to avoid these devices altogether. Instead of engaging in questionable USB behavior, don&rsquo;t cheap out on USB devices and cables. If it&rsquo;s going to get plugged into your computer, ensure you&rsquo;re being extra cautious. Buy it from the manufacturer (like the Apple Store) or from a reputable company or reseller with supply chain control. When juicing up USB-rechargeables, don&rsquo;t plug them into your computer. Use <a href="https://heronebag.com/blog/40-hours-drive-time-my-road-trip-charging-essentials/">a wall charger with a USB port</a> instead.</p>
<h2 id="practice-healthy-cybersecurity-habits">Practice healthy cybersecurity habits</h2>
<p>Keeping your devices healthy and happy is a matter of practicing good habits. Like battling the flu, good habits can help protect yourself and those around you. Incorporate some conscientious cybersecurity practices in your new year resolutions - or start them right away.</p>
<p>Have a safe and happy holiday!</p>

The same is true for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa-enabled devices, Google Home, and other Internet-connected appliances like cameras, lightbulbs, and toasters. Yes, they have those now.</p>
<p>Like puppies, IoT devices are still young. Many contain <a href="https://threatpost.com/iot-devices-vulnerable-takeover/144167/">known vulnerabilities</a> that remote attackers can use to gain access to device owners' networks. These attacks are sometimes as laughably simple as using a default username and password that the <a href="https://gdpr.report/news/2019/06/12/research-reveals-the-most-vulnerable-iot-devices/">device owner cannot change</a>.</p>
<p>Does all this mean you shouldn&rsquo;t give Grandma Mabel a new app-enabled coffee maker or Ring doorbell for Christmas? Probably, although not necessarily. Like puppies, properly-maintained IoT devices are capable of warming your heart without causing <em>too</em> much havoc; but they take a lot of work to care for. Here are a few responsibilities to keep in mind for the care and feeding of an IoT device.</p>
<h2 id="immature-security">Immature security</h2>
<p>Many manufacturers of IoT devices <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/vulnerabilities-in-iot-devices/">have not made security a priority</a>. There aren&rsquo;t yet any enforced <a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2019/03/27/the-iot-cybersecurity-improvement-act-of-2019/">security requirements</a> for this industry, which leaves the protection of your device and the network it&rsquo;s connected to in the hands of the manufacturer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just obscure no-name toasters, either; malicious third-party apps have snuck onto Amazon&rsquo;s and Google&rsquo;s more reputable devices and enabled attackers to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/alexa-and-google-voice-assistants-app-exploits-left-it-vulnerable-to-eavesdropping/">eavesdrop</a> on unsuspecting owners.</p>
<p>Until security regulations are put in place and enforced, it&rsquo;s buyer beware for both devices and third-party applications. To the extent possible, potential owners must do ample research to weed out vulnerable devices and untrustworthy apps.</p>
<h2 id="protecting-your-network">Protecting your network</h2>
<p>If you think hackers aren&rsquo;t likely to find your device in the vast expanse of the Internet, you might be wrong. These days, obscurity doesn&rsquo;t provide security. It&rsquo;s no longer left up to a potential attacker&rsquo;s fallible human eyes to find your insecure front door camera in a cacophony of wireless traffic; <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2013/04/08/technology/security/shodan/index.html">IoT search engines</a> like <a href="https://www.shodan.io/">Shodan</a> will do that for them. Thankfully, these search engines are also used for good, enabling white hat hackers and penetration testers to find and fix insecure devices.</p>
<p>Just like locking your own front door, IoT owners are responsible for locking down access to their devices. This may mean searching through device settings to make sure default credentials are changed, or checking to make sure that a device used on your private home network doesn&rsquo;t by default have public Internet access.</p>
<p>Where the options are available, HTTPS and <a href="/blog/personal-cybersecurity-posture-for-when-youre-just-this-guy-you-know/#1-use-multifactor-authentication">multifactor authentication</a> should be enabled. The use of a <a href="/blog/personal-cybersecurity-posture-for-when-youre-just-this-guy-you-know/#2-use-a-vpn">VPN</a> can also keep your devices from being found.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-them-patched">Keeping them patched</h2>
<p>Unlike puppies, many IoT devices are &ldquo;headless&rdquo; and have no inherent way of interfacing with a human. An app-controlled lightbulb, for example, may be all but useless without the software that makes it shine. As convenient as it may be to have your 1500K mood lighting come on automatically at dusk, it also means automatically ceding control of the device to its software developers.</p>
<p>When vulnerabilities in your phone&rsquo;s operating system are discovered and patched, it&rsquo;s likely that automatic updates are pushed and installed overnight, possibly without you even knowing. Your IoT device, on the other hand, may have no such support. In those cases, it&rsquo;s completely up to the user to discover that an update is needed, find and download the patch, then correctly update their device. Even for owners with some technical expertise, this process takes significant effort. Many <a href="https://www.machinedesign.com/industrial-automation/software-updates-are-new-hurdle-iot-security">device owners aren&rsquo;t even aware</a> that their software is dangerously outdated.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means that users without the time, knowledge, or willingness to keep their devices updated should reconsider owning them. Alternatively, some research can help prospective owners choose devices that receive automatic push updates from their (hopefully responsible) manufacturers over WiFi.</p>
<h2 id="being-responsible">Being responsible</h2>
<p>Raising a healthy and happy IoT device is no small task, especially for potential owners with little time or willingness to put in the required effort. With the proper attention and maintenance, your Internet-connected appliance can bring joy and convenience to your life; but without, it introduces a potential security risk and a whole lot of trouble.</p>

I alluded to an overarching security lesson that I hope to make explicit today: the security of our software, application, and customer data is built from the ground up, long before the product goes live.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a> is a comprehensive guide to web application security risks. It is relied upon by technology professionals, corporations, and those interested in cybersecurity or information security. The most recent publication lists Sensitive Data Exposure as the third most critical web application security risk. Here&rsquo;s how the risk is described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sensitive Data Exposure&rdquo; is a sort of catch-all category for leaked data resulting from many sources, ranging from weak cryptographic algorithms to unenforced encryption. The simplest source of this security risk, however, takes far fewer syllables to describe: people.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,&rdquo; applies to medicine as well as secure software development. In the world of the latter, this is referred to as &ldquo;pushing left,&rdquo; a rather unintuitive term for establishing security best practices earlier, rather than later, in the software development life cycle (SDLC). Establishing procedures &ldquo;to the left&rdquo; of the SDLC can help ensure that the people involved in creating a software product are properly taking care of sensitive data from day one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a good amount of security testing often seems to occur much farther to the right side of the SDLC; too late for some security issues, such as sensitive data leakage, to be prevented.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the authors contributing to the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Testing-Guide-v5">OWASP Testing Guide</a> and recently expanded a section on search engine discovery reconnaissance, or what the kids these days call &ldquo;Google dorking.&rdquo; This is one method, and arguably the most accessible method, by which a security tester (or black hat hacker) could find exposed sensitive data on the Internet. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from that section (currently a work in progress on GitHub, to be released in v5):</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="search-operators">Search Operators</h3>
<p>A search operator is a special keyword that extends the capabilities of regular search queries, and can help obtain more specific results. They generally take the form of <code>operator:query</code>. Here are some commonly supported search operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>site:</code> will limit the search to the provided URL.</li>
<li><code>inurl:</code> will only return results that include the keyword in the URL.</li>
<li><code>intitle:</code> will only return results that have the keyword in the page title.</li>
<li><code>intext:</code> or <code>inbody:</code> will only search for the keyword in the body of pages.</li>
<li><code>filetype:</code> will match only a specific filetype, i.e. png, or php.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to find the web content of owasp.org as indexed by a typical search engine, the syntax required is:</p>
<p><code>site:owasp.org</code></p>
<p>&hellip;
Searching with operators can be a very effective discovery reconnaissance technique when combined with the creativity of the tester. Operators can be chained to effectively discover specific kinds of sensitive files and information. This technique, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking">Google hacking</a> or Google dorking, is also possible using other search engines, as long as the search operators are supported.</p>
<p>A database of dorks, such as <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database">Google Hacking Database</a>, is a useful resource that can help uncover specific information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regularly reviewing search engine results can be a fruitful task for security testers. However, when a search for <code>site:myapp.com passwords</code> turns up no results, it may still be a little too early to break for lunch. Here are a couple other places a security tester might like to look for sensitive data exposed in the wild.</p>
<h2 id="pastebin">Pastebin</h2>
<p>The self-declared &ldquo;#1 paste tool since 2002,&rdquo; <a href="https://pastebin.com">Pastebin</a> allows users to temporarily store any kind of text. It&rsquo;s mostly used for sharing information with others, or retrieving your own &ldquo;paste&rdquo; on another machine, perhaps in another location. Pastebin makes it easy to share large amounts of complicated text, like error logs, source code, configuration files, tokens, api keys&hellip; what&rsquo;s that? Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s public by default.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of a little dorking I did for a public bug bounty program.</p>

            <p>Log-in details out in the open.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Thanks in part to the convenience of using Pastebin and similar websites, it would appear that some people fail to think twice before making sensitive data publicly available.</p>
<h3 id="but-why">But why</h3>
<p>Granted, non-technical employees with access to the application may not have an understanding of which items should or should not be freely shared. Someone unfamiliar with what encrypted data is or what it looks like may not realize the difference between an encrypted string and an unencrypted token made up of many random letters and numbers. Even technical staff can miss things, make mistakes, or act carelessly after a hard day at work. It may be easy to call this a training problem and move on; however, none of these rationalizations address the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p>When people turn to outside solutions for an issue they face, it&rsquo;s usually because they haven&rsquo;t been provided with an equally-appealing internal solution, or are unaware that one exists. Employees using pastes to share or move sensitive data do so because they don&rsquo;t have an easier, more convenient, and secure internal solution to use instead.</p>
<h3 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h3>
<p>Everyone involved in the creation and maintenance of a web application should be briefed on a few basic things in regards to sensitive data protection:</p>
<ol>
<li>what constitutes sensitive data,</li>
<li>the difference between plain text and encrypted data, and</li>
<li>how to properly transmit and store sensitive data.</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to third-party services, ensure people are aware that some transmission may not be encrypted, or may be publicly searchable. If there is no system currently in place for safely sharing and storing sensitive data internally, this is a good place to start. The security of application data is in the hands of everyone on the team, from administrative staff to C-level executives. Ensure people have the tools they need to work securely.</p>
<h2 id="public-repositories">Public repositories</h2>
<p>Developers are notorious for leaving sensitive information hanging out where it doesn&rsquo;t belong (yes, I&rsquo;ve done it too!). Without a strong push-left approach in place for handling tokens, secrets, and keys, these little gems can end up in full public view on sites like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket (to name a few). <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_04B-3_Meli_paper.pdf">A 2019 study</a> found that thousands of new, unique secrets are leaked every day on GitHub alone.</p>
<figure class="screenshot"><img src="github_tok.png"
         alt="A screenshot of a Google search for tokens on GitHub"/>
</figure>

<p>GitHub has implemented measures like <a href="https://github.blog/2018-10-17-behind-the-scenes-of-github-token-scanning/">token scanning</a>, and GitLab 11.9 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2019/03/22/gitlab-11-9-released/">introduced secret detection</a>. While these tools aim to reduce the chances that a secret might accidentally be committed, to put it bluntly, it&rsquo;s really not their job. Secret scanning won&rsquo;t stop developers from committing the data in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-1">But why</h3>
<p>Without an obvious process in place for managing secrets, developers may tend too much towards their innate sense of just-get-it-done-ness. Sometimes this leads to the expedient but irresponsible practice of storing keys as unencrypted variables within the program, perhaps with the intention of it being temporary. Nonetheless, these variables inevitably fall from front of mind and end up in a commit.</p>
<h3 id="mitigation-1">Mitigation</h3>
<p>Having a strong push-left culture means ensuring that sensitive data is properly stored and can be securely retrieved long before anyone is ready to make a commit. Tools and strategies for doing so are readily available for those who seek them. Here are some examples of tools that can support a push-left approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a management tool to store and control access to keys and secrets, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Amazon Key Management Service</a> or Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a>.</li>
<li>Make use of encrypted environment variables in CI tools, such as <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#environment-variables">Netlify&rsquo;s environment variables</a> or <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables">virtual environments in GitHub Actions</a>.</li>
<li>Craft a robust <code>.gitignore</code> file that everyone on the team can contribute to and use.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need not rely entirely on the public repository to catch those mistakes that may still slip through. It&rsquo;s possible to set up Git pre-commit hooks that scan for committed secrets using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>. There are some open-source programs available for this, such as <a href="https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman">Talisman from ThoughtWorks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets">git-secrets from AWS Labs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-left-to-prevent-sensitive-data-exposure">Pushing left to prevent sensitive data exposure</h2>
<p>A little perspective can go a long way in demonstrating why it&rsquo;s important to begin managing sensitive data even before any sensitive data exists. By establishing security best practices on the left of the SDLC, we give our people the best chance to increase the odds that any future dorking on our software product looks more like this.</p>

<p>Another great resource for checking up on the security of our data is Troy Hunt&rsquo;s <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>, a service that compares your data (such as your email) to data that has been leaked in previous data breaches.</p>
<p>To learn about more ways we can be proactive with our application security, the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/">OWASP Proactive Controls</a> publication is a great resource. There&rsquo;s also more about creating a push-left approach to security in the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Testing-Guide-v5">OWASP Testing Guide</a>. If these topics interest you, I encourage you to read, learn, and contribute so more people will make it harder for sensitive data to be found.</p>
