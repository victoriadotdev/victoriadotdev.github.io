It\u0026rsquo;s one of the few things I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to do since I was young, but haven\u0026rsquo;t yet done. This is because I have trouble convincing myself that putting in the effort to create a cohesive book would be more valuable than putting the same effort into writing articles on my site, which are read by thousands each week.\nI have roughly three books' worth of words written on victoria.dev, about 112,000 words today. It\u0026rsquo;s my personal database of what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned and how I\u0026rsquo;ve done it. I want it to be public, accessible, and helpful to those who find it. I refer folks I mentor to my own articles \u0026ndash; not because it\u0026rsquo;s my blog, but because I once found a great way to explain the thing I want to explain, and I\u0026rsquo;ve preserved it for anyone to reference.\nYes, I know I can sell a book and that it\u0026rsquo;s nigh impossible to sell an article on my blog. I have a page for buying me coffee where folks can show their appreciation, but it\u0026rsquo;s nothing close to a significant portion of my income. I feel like there\u0026rsquo;s something bigger to be had here than a side income stream.\nEvery significant source of income I\u0026rsquo;ve had in tech has come as a result of someone seeing an article I wrote on my site or an open source project I created. Had I folded any of that away in a book, I think it would have been far less likely to have been found.\nI want other people to benefit from what I\u0026rsquo;ve made and I think friction is key. The reason we love search engines is because they essentially eliminate friction between you and the whole Internet. When my articles are searchable, someone can find them \u0026ndash; someone who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily buy, or couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford, that same information in a book, yet who has all the necessary chutzpah to be a self-learner and succeed. Even a free book with no more friction than \u0026ldquo;click here to download\u0026rdquo; gives you one more button you have to press.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen countless how-to\u0026rsquo;s when it comes to self-marketing. How to get more Twitter followers, how to build your audience, how to get more newsletter subscribers. They all seem, to me, to boil down to one thing. Provide some value for free. Or, to put it another way that sounds better: provide a window to your value that is accessible to all.\nThis makes me think that setting out to make money is really missing the mark. The success stories I\u0026rsquo;ve read over this past helluva year are tales of independent creators and entrepreneurs \u0026ndash; upstarts who\u0026rsquo;ve discovered ways to provide value to people who needed something. Money, if there was any to be had, followed.\nIn my own case, the value I provide for free in turn attracts lucrative short-term freelance work and six-figure long-term positions. Had it just been a one-off experience, I\u0026rsquo;d have called it serendipitous. After multiple times, I think I have to call it strategy.\nIn summary, let me impress the importance I perceive in removing as much friction as possible from demonstrating the value you can provide. Give it away for free. Make it accessible to all. Be generous.\nMy theory is that this, in turn, attracts value to you. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s the value of effective altruism, or purely monetary gain. My own story supports this, but I\u0026rsquo;m just one data point. Will you help me experiment?\n","date":"2020-12-25T16:04:39-05:00","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"2020 12 25 16:04:39","uri":"https://victoria.dev/neofeed/2020-12-25-160439/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"When presented with an offer like \u0026ldquo;Get $10 when you sign up today,\u0026rdquo; the question you should be asking to make the proper value calculation is, \u0026ldquo;Am I willing to start this new habit for $10?\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"2020-12-21T16:13:00Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"1341054072204521475","uri":"https://victoria.dev/neofeed/1341054072204521475/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"Hi mom.\n","date":"2020-12-20T16:41:05-05:00","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"2020 12 20 16:41:04","uri":"https://victoria.dev/neofeed/2020-12-20-164104/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m experimenting.\n","date":"2020-12-19T21:11:37-05:00","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"2020 12 19 21:11:37","uri":"https://victoria.dev/neofeed/2020-12-19-211137/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"The process of writing and editing your own work is to temporarily fall in love with your words and then break up with them repeatedly.\nDraft like you’re half-drunk.

So I searched my blog (site:https://victoria.dev ia writer working copy) and found my post from 20 months ago explaining the set up.\nA remote sync solution for iOS and Linux: Git and Working Copy\nI followed my own instructions but one of the steps didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. Either I missed something the first time, or the process changed since I wrote it up.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s ok! I had a head start on my research already thanks to what I wrote, and in a few minutes I found the new answer. I decided to update the post and in so doing I realized it\u0026rsquo;s the second time I\u0026rsquo;ve updated it to add something new! It’s like past me leaving helpful tips for future me, months or years ago.\nMany people read my blog, and I’m flattered by the feedback I receive. I’m happy that I’m able to help so many other people, but I also don’t write it for other people primarily.\nI write down the things I do and what I learn from doing them because it’s like having a second, more-perfect brain. My meat-brain will forget the details, but my disk-brain can retain its accuracy indefinitely.\nI often get questions like, “how do I choose a theme for my blog?” or “what platform should I use?” or “what popular language/framework/topic should I focus on?” My answer is: don’t start with that. Start with you.\nChoose whatever publishing option is easiest for you right now, then start by writing for yourself. Write about what interests you. Try something new, even if it seems rudimentary, and write in-depth about what you learn. (One of my most popular posts is about iteration in Python. When I first wrote it, I considered myself a complete beginner.)\nWrite for yourself by explaining what you’re doing, as if it were past-you teaching future-you — because it is. You will be your first reader, and the first judge of how useful your blog can be. Seek to impress yourself!\nMake it a habit, and I think the rest will follow.\n","date":"2020-12-07T10:20:54Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"1335977389810200581","uri":"https://victoria.dev/neofeed/1335977389810200581/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"To understand the world, travel.\nTo understand yourself, stay home.\n","date":"2020-12-02T13:26:00Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"1334126675836227584","uri":"https://victoria.dev/neofeed/1334126675836227584/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, you found the secret room. 🎉\nThere are cookies. 🍪🍪🍪\n","date":"2020-11-28T14:30:00Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"33342","uri":"https://victoria.dev/neofeed/33342/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"\u0026ldquo;You cannot push anyone up a ladder unless he be willing to climb a little himself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Andrew Carnegie\n","date":"2020-11-25T13:26:00Z","site":"https://victoria.dev/","tags":null,"title":"1331589960604979200","uri":"https://victoria.dev/neofeed/1331589960604979200/"},{"author":{"about":"Victoria Drake, Director of Engineering, is building better cybersecurity and happy and productive technical teams.","email":"hello@victoria.dev","image":"img/victoria_headshot.jpg","name":"Victoria Drake"},"categories":null,"content":"The secret to good documentation is to write it while you\u0026rsquo;re writing the code.
