For a very brief moment a bajillion years ago I was an office manager at a very new marketing startup.
 The CEO had just signed the lease for the office. It smelled like dust and packing tape. There was no furniture yet besides a folding table and chairs, but one wall was lined with boxes of swag, so there was that."><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/img/favicon.ico><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/main.min.71cbc564770c1c541845a79e9a6bae6f07b737e023065df6aab4d7d48232b2d2.css integrity="sha256-ccvFZHcMHFQYRaeemmuubwe3N+AjBl32qrTX1IIystI=" media=screen></head><body><header role=banner><nav aria-label="Victoria.dev main menu" id=menu><ul role=menubar><li role=none class=menu-item><a role=menuitem href=/><img src=/img/bookmark.svg alt="home page icon" height=18px class=filter-icon> hi</a></li><li role=none class=menu-item><a role=menuitem href=/blog/><img src=/img/quote.svg alt="blog icon" height=18px class=filter-icon> blog</a></li><li role=none class=menu-item><a role=menuitem href=/about/><img src=/img/profile.svg alt="about page icon" height=18px class=filter-icon> about</a></li><li role=none class=menu-item><a role=menuitem href=/coffee/><img src=/img/coffee.svg alt="coffee icon" height=18px class=filter-icon> buy me coffee</a></li><li role=none class=menu-item><a role=menuitem href=/bookshelf/><img src=/img/book.svg alt="bookshelf icon" height=18px class=filter-icon> bookshelf</a></li><li role=none class=menu-item><a role=menuitem id=rss href=https://victoria.dev/index.xml rel=alternate type=application/rss+xml title="RSS for It didn't happen exactly like that"><img src=/img/rss.svg alt="RSS icon" height=18px class=filter-icon> rss</a></li></ul></nav></header><main aria-role=main><div class=container><article class=h-entry><h1 class=title-header>It didn't happen exactly like that</h1><span><a class="tag button" href=/tags//>ü•ö

She‚Äôll mostly be telling you what to do.‚Äù he said, opening another box. ‚ÄúDo you like hoodies?‚Äù It didn&rsquo;t happen exactly like that, but it may as well have.</p><p>I met the Manager. ‚ÄúThe CEO says you have a lot of drive and ideas,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great. You should always feel free to tell me about any ideas you have, so I can bring them to the CEO."</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s great, because I have some ideas about how we can be more productive and I&rsquo;d like to work my way up in the company.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; said the Manager. &ldquo;Here, I have some papers for you to shuffle.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t happen exactly like that, but it may as well have.</p><p>Some time later the Manager came by my desk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to start making some cold calls to prospective customers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a list.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that more in the sales teams' wheelhouse?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very interested in being a salesperson and making cold calls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, they aren&rsquo;t really cold calls. They&rsquo;re more like a non-zero-probability-of-warmth calls,&rdquo; said the Manager.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you get my email about making our onboarding process more efficient?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I can start working on that if you think it makes sense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the Manager, leaving the call list on my desk.</p><p>Most of the logo had worn off my company stress ball when I went to see the CEO. &ldquo;I have some concerns about making these cold calls.&rdquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said the CEO, looking up from a mug of coffee with the company logo printed on it. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t the sales team be doing this? I imagine they&rsquo;d be better at it, having had sales training.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; said the CEO. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.
