<p>The CEO had just signed the lease for the office. It smelled like dust and packing tape. There was no furniture yet besides a folding table and chairs, but one wall was lined with boxes of swag, so there was that.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs our office manager, you&rsquo;ll be responsible for our office,‚Äù said the CEO, tossing me a foam stress ball with the new company&rsquo;s logo printed on it. ‚ÄúYou&rsquo;ll provide any administrative support we need.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, giving my new swag an obligatory squeeze. ‚ÄúAnd who will I be working with?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôll report to the Manager. She‚Äôll mostly be telling you what to do.‚Äù he said, opening another box. ‚ÄúDo you like hoodies?‚Äù It didn&rsquo;t happen exactly like that, but it may as well have.</p>
<p>I met the Manager. ‚ÄúThe CEO says you have a lot of drive and ideas,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great. You should always feel free to tell me about any ideas you have, so I can bring them to the CEO.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s great, because I have some ideas about how we can be more productive and I&rsquo;d like to work my way up in the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; said the Manager. &ldquo;Here, I have some papers for you to shuffle.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t happen exactly like that, but it may as well have.</p>
<p>Some time later the Manager came by my desk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to start making some cold calls to prospective customers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that more in the sales teams' wheelhouse?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very interested in being a salesperson and making cold calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, they aren&rsquo;t really cold calls. They&rsquo;re more like a non-zero-probability-of-warmth calls,&rdquo; said the Manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get my email about making our onboarding process more efficient?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I can start working on that if you think it makes sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the Manager, leaving the call list on my desk.</p>
<p>Most of the logo had worn off my company stress ball when I went to see the CEO. &ldquo;I have some concerns about making these cold calls.&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said the CEO, looking up from a mug of coffee with the company logo printed on it. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t the sales team be doing this? I imagine they&rsquo;d be better at it, having had sales training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; said the CEO. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I&rsquo;ll talk to the sales team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Do we even have a sales team?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuse me, I have a phone call.&rdquo; said the CEO, waving me out of his office.</p>
<p>On my last day there, I went to see the Manager. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;m making much of an impact here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to resign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said the Manager, &ldquo;because the CEO wants to fire you anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, surprised. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; she said, surprised. &ldquo;For what you said. You didn&rsquo;t make any cold calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen exactly like that, but it may as well have.</p>
