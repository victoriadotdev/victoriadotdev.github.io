It was a blue 150-page spiral bound notebook that I carried with me everywhere. In it, with a painstakingly-chosen <em>professional artists'</em> mechanical pencil, I was writing my first novel. In a suspenseful twisting epic, a young enterprising female detective would solve the mystery of a lost crystal of unfathomable monetary worth and historical significance. I knew that the resilience of my super sleuth heroine would lead her to succeed. Writing out how she learned and grew by overcoming the trials and challenges along the way was the fulfilling part.</p><p>One day, in a life-altering turn of events somewhere between recess and a game of dodge ball in gym class, I lost my notebook.</p><p>I spent what was probably up to a whole hour, otherwise known as forever, running from classroom to classroom in search of the physical representation of my entire future career as a famous author. Eventually, I found what was left of it: a barely-recognizable tattered mess of torn pages. Some of them were scribbled over with red crayon. It may as well have been my own blood. I was crushed. I may have cried.</p><p>After an appropriate period of mourning that may have lasted a whole day, I got another notebook. In it, with my professional artists' mechanical pencil, I started my second novel.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember what the second one was about - nor my third, fourth, or the ones after those. As you can imagine, the topics matter little. I kept working, and the complexity of the work grew up with me. I developed a habit of perseverance that serves me well in daily life and in my profession as a software engineer; one that has stood the test of far more trying circumstances than the weekly dramas of childhood. To be fair, I had never seen it in that light until I discovered books and resources that helped me think of grit as a skill to cultivate. One recent book put so fine a point on it (through a story far more dire than any of my own) that it has become my top-shelf recommendation on the topic. Though it is an entirely worthwhile read, I will summarize.</p><p>Everything seems serious when you&rsquo;re young and inexperienced. As a kid with a comparatively smaller frame of reference for the trials and exaltations of living, everything that happens to you is the worst or best thing you can imagine. Historically, the passing of years would help to grow this frame of reference, but today, it&rsquo;s not enough. Today, the vast majority of people on the planet enjoy far more comfortable lives than any of our ancestors could have imagined. Running water alone provided our forefathers with the mental capacity to invent and industrialize on a never-before-seen scale; now we&rsquo;ve got <em>Internet</em>. The dark shadow of this bright future? We grow up with less appreciation for hardship, having had less hardship to beat.</p><p>Personal success, no matter what you decide that means to you, doesn&rsquo;t come without doing the hard work that your soul is calling out for you to do. Exemplary success comes when you do the hard work that others are not willing to do. It takes mental toughness, resilience, and grit to keep doing hard work. It takes every type of effortful endurance in the face of every type of adversity.</p><p>It is only by intentionally deciding to do and then doing hard work that you can develop a maturity of perception. This allows you to separate that which is trivial distraction from that which is truly fulfilling. This allows you to evaluate, rehash, rebuild, iterate, and become better at your craft. People who cultivate this ability are the ones who succeed. People who cultivate this ability have made the world a better place.</p><p>I appreciated <a href=https://amzn.to/3lNoYR5>Fortitude, by Dan Crenshaw</a>, for many reasons. It is a timely amalgamation of philosophies, pragmatic suggestions for systems that encourage mental toughness, and moving personal stories that remind me of the irreplaceable things in life. Books like Fortitude exemplify a mindset that makes success inevitable. By cultivating this mindset, like my super sleuth heroine, I know my resilience will lead me to succeed. Learning and growing by overcoming the trials and challenges along the way is the fulfilling part.</p></div><a class=hidden href=https://brid.gy/publish/twitter></a><a class=hidden href=https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon></a><data class=p-bridgy-omit-link value=false></data></article><div id=up-container><a href=# id=up>&#709;</a></div><div class=page-separator><hr></div><div id=webmentions></div><div class=related><code class=language-sql data-lang=sql>SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Related;</code><ul role=menubar id=article-list></ul><div class=page-separator><p class=back-link><a href=/blog>&lt;&lt; Back to blog</a></p></div></div></div><footer class=container><div class="markdown bio h-card p-author"><strong><a href=https://victoria.dev/ class="u-url p-name">Victoria Drake</a></strong><figure class="profile title-avatar u-photo"><img src=/img/victoria_headshot.jpg alt="Victoria's headshot"></figure><p>Victoria Drake is a Director of Engineering in Washington, DC.
