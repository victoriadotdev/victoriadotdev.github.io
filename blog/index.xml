Signal had so many new users sign up that it overwhelmed their existing infrastructure and lead to a 24-hour-ish outage. The small team responded impressively quickly, especially given that a 4,200% spike in new users was utterly implausible before it ocurred.</description></item><item><title>Create a self-hosted chat service with your own Matrix server</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/create-a-self-hosted-chat-service-with-your-own-matrix-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 01:38:07 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/create-a-self-hosted-chat-service-with-your-own-matrix-server/</guid><description>Matrix is an open standard for decentralized real-time communication. The specification is production-ready and bridges to tons of silo products like Slack, Gitter, Telegram, Discord, and even Facebook Messenger. This lets you use Matrix to link together disjoint communities in one place, or create an alternative communication method that works with, but is independent of, communication silos.
You can create your own self-hosted Matrix chat for as little as $3.50 USD per month on an AWS Lightsail instance.</description></item><item><title>Do I raise or return errors in Python?</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/do-i-raise-or-return-errors-in-python/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 05:34:48 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/do-i-raise-or-return-errors-in-python/</guid><description>I hear this question a lot: &amp;ldquo;Do I raise or return this error in Python?&amp;rdquo;
This is probably because the right answer will depend on your situation and the goals of your application logic. Either choice can help you ensure your Python code doesn&amp;rsquo;t fail silently, saving you and your teammates from having to hunt down deeply entrenched errors.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the difference between raise and return when handling failures in Python, and how to ensure your code doesn&amp;rsquo;t fail silently.</description></item><item><title>What tech leaders do before going on vacation</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/what-tech-leaders-do-before-going-on-vacation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 04:02:54 -0600</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/what-tech-leaders-do-before-going-on-vacation/</guid><description>As a technical person who leads a technical team, I know firsthand that it can be easy to get lost in finishing up your own work before a vacation. It takes a bit of dedicated attention to ensure you don&amp;rsquo;t neglect the day-to-day tasks that don’t vanish while you’re away.
Here’s a pre-PTO checklist to make sure you’ve taken care of those responsibilities before you take off for a much-deserved vacation.</description></item><item><title>Add search to Hugo static sites with Lunr</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/add-search-to-hugo-static-sites-with-lunr/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2021 09:25:17 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/add-search-to-hugo-static-sites-with-lunr/</guid><description>Yes, you can have an interactive search feature on your static site!

It was made up of HTML experiments frankensteined together by people still figuring it all out.
The beauty of not completely knowing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing is a lack of premature judgement. Without a standard to rise to, you&amp;rsquo;re free to go sideways. Explore. Try things that don&amp;rsquo;t work, without any expectation they will work. An open world with a beginner&amp;rsquo;s mindset.</description></item><item><title>How to get hired as a software developer</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-get-hired-as-a-software-developer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 05:50:53 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-get-hired-as-a-software-developer/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m asked this question a lot, so let me be the first to give you the good news: there&amp;rsquo;s no one right answer. As general tech-literacy increases, the culture of the coding industry is steadily, thankfully, moving away from a checklist approach. Instead of degrees and pre-requisites when it comes to deciding whether you&amp;rsquo;re qualified to be hired as a software developer, companies (including my own) are far more concerned with just one question.</description></item><item><title>How to become a software developer</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-become-a-software-developer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 04:50:07 -0600</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-become-a-software-developer/</guid><description>As a Director of Engineering, I’m a software developer who hires and leads other software developers. It’s not surprising then that I get asked this question a lot, in various forms:
How do I become a software developer? What language or framework should I learn first? Where do I start? While I’m certain there’s no one right answer for everyone, I’m also certain that the world needs more software developers and systems thinkers.</description></item><item><title>Be brave and build in public</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/be-brave-and-build-in-public/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 04:57:31 -0600</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/be-brave-and-build-in-public/</guid><description>I used to think that when I wanted to make updates to a project, I ought to hold back and do a big re-launch with all the changes at once. I figured that seeing big changes would feel like Christmas!
Unfortunately, Christmas only comes once a year. After years in the tech and cybersecurity world, my perspective has changed.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found that people, including myself, value receiving small, constant, incremental improvements far more than big changes once or a few times a year.</description></item><item><title>So you're the family tech support</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/so-youre-the-family-tech-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:42:24 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/so-youre-the-family-tech-support/</guid><description>🎄🌟 Happy holidays! 🌟🎄

Whether you&amp;rsquo;re leading a team of people or leading yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s important to take account of all the important things that need doing in your organization. This does not mean that everything can be equally important.
Logically, everything can&amp;rsquo;t be. Tasks are typically interdependent, and there&amp;rsquo;s always one task on which another depends. Tasks can be time-sensitive. Certain tasks might block a logical path towards a goal.</description></item><item><title>OWASP Web Security Testing Guide v4.2 released</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/owasp-web-security-testing-guide-v4.2-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:02:33 -0600</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/owasp-web-security-testing-guide-v4.2-released/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m very happy and proud to share that the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Web Security Testing Guide v4.2 is now available!

This skill was instrumental to the creation of the Internet. If no one had imagined the underlying technology that most now take for granted every day, there would be no cat memes.
To make the Internet possible, two things that needed imagining are layers and protocols. Layers are conceptual divides that group similar functions together.</description></item><item><title>Responsive pages and color themes with minimal CSS</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/responsive-pages-and-color-themes-with-minimal-css/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 06:04:58 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/responsive-pages-and-color-themes-with-minimal-css/</guid><description>Hello, do come in!

A lesser-known purpose is to protect your privacy right in your own home, from your own internet service provider (ISP).
A set of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules entitled &amp;ldquo;Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services&amp;rdquo; were unfortunately struck down in 2017.

Mt. Fuji is, some folks would say, the cakewalk of mountain climbing.

For spiritual reasons, some Japanese folks make the climb at ages upwards of 80 years.

Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some examples of aliases, functions, and prompt configurations that can improve our workflow by helping us be more efficient with fewer key presses.</description></item><item><title>How to set up a fresh Ubuntu desktop using only dotfiles and bash scripts</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-set-up-a-fresh-ubuntu-desktop-using-only-dotfiles-and-bash-scripts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 07:58:18 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-set-up-a-fresh-ubuntu-desktop-using-only-dotfiles-and-bash-scripts/</guid><description>One of my most favorite things about open source files on GitHub is the ability to see how others do (what some people might call) mundane things, like set up their .bashrc and other dotfiles.

As part of some recent explorations into automatically re-creating my laptop with Bash scripts, I wanted to find a way to easily clone my GitHub-hosted repositories to a new machine. After a bit of digging around, I wrote a one-liner that did just that. Then, in the spirit of not putting all our eggs in the same basket, I wrote another one-liner to automatically create and push to GitLab-hosted backups as well.</description></item><item><title>A quick guide to changing your GitHub username</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/a-quick-guide-to-changing-your-github-username/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 15:19:13 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/a-quick-guide-to-changing-your-github-username/</guid><description>This being the 2,38947234th and probably last time I&amp;rsquo;ll change my username, (marriage is permanent, right?)

Along with a static site generator like Hugo, keeping a blog up to date is pretty painless.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used Hugo to build my site for years, but until this past week I&amp;rsquo;d never hooked up my Pages repository to any deployment service. Why? Because using a tool that built my site before deploying it seemed to require having the whole recipe in one place - and if you&amp;rsquo;re using GitHub Pages with the free version of GitHub, that place is public.</description></item><item><title>A remote sync solution for iOS and Linux: Git and Working Copy</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/a-remote-sync-solution-for-ios-and-linux-git-and-working-copy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 11:55:28 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/a-remote-sync-solution-for-ios-and-linux-git-and-working-copy/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for pockets of time in which I can be productive.

Think of it as having a superpower that allows you to know exactly what type of program might be the most efficient in a particular situation - before even running a single line of code.
The fundamental concepts of complexity analysis are well worth studying. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to better understand how the code you&amp;rsquo;re writing will interact with the program&amp;rsquo;s input, and as a result, you&amp;rsquo;ll spend a lot less wasted time writing slow and problematic code.</description></item><item><title>Knapsack problem algorithms for my real-life carry-on knapsack</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/knapsack-problem-algorithms-for-my-real-life-carry-on-knapsack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2018 21:00:35 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/knapsack-problem-algorithms-for-my-real-life-carry-on-knapsack/</guid><description>The knapsack problem I&amp;rsquo;m a nomad and live out of one carry-on bag.

While using the service has its pros (like https and a mobile responsive website, and being very visual and beginner-friendly) it&amp;rsquo;s limiting. For someone who&amp;rsquo;s comfortable enough to be tweaking CSS but who&amp;rsquo;s not interested in creating their own theme (or paying upwards of $50 for one), I felt I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really the type of consumer WordPress.com was suited to.

Subtle differences in terminology like iteration, iterator, iterating, and iterable aren&amp;rsquo;t the most beginner-friendly.
When tackling new concepts, I find concrete examples to be most useful. I&amp;rsquo;ll share some in this post and discuss appropriate situations for each. (Pun intended.)
For loop First, in pseudocode:
for iterating_variable in iterable: statement(s) I find for loops to be the most readable way to iterate in Python.</description></item><item><title>The basics of streaming with Twitter API</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/the-basics-of-streaming-with-twitter-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2017 16:39:29 +0700</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/the-basics-of-streaming-with-twitter-api/</guid><description>Twitter has begun asking users to apply to use the API, presumably to cut down on unpalatable uses. This article is still relevant, however, no longer represents the best way to get started with Twitter API streaming. For more on the current API, please see the Twitter API Docs. This post covers my initial adventures in exploring Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Streaming API. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about:
