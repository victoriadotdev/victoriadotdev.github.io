Picking the type of password you need can seem like an arbitrary choice. After all, WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 all have mostly the same letters in them. A password is a password, so what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?
About 60 seconds to billions of years, as it turns out.
All Wi-Fi encryption is not created equal. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what makes these four acronyms so different, and how you can best protect your home and organization Wi-Fi.</description></item><item><title>What is TLS?

If you want to send data confidentially over the Internet, you might have a few more considerations to cover.
TLS, or Transport Layer Security, refers to a protocol. &amp;ldquo;Protocol&amp;rdquo; is a word that means, &amp;ldquo;the way we&amp;rsquo;ve agreed to do things around here,&amp;rdquo; more or less.</description></item><item><title>How to choose and care for a secure open source project</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-choose-and-care-for-a-secure-open-source-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 05:53:09 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-choose-and-care-for-a-secure-open-source-project/</guid><description>There is a rather progressive sect of the software development world that believes that most people would be a lot happier and get a lot more work done if they just stopped building things that someone else has already built and is offering up for free use. They&amp;rsquo;re called the open source community. They want you to take their stuff.
Besides existing without you having to lift a finger, open source tools and software have some distinct advantages.</description></item><item><title>If you want to build a treehouse, start at the bottom</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/if-you-want-to-build-a-treehouse-start-at-the-bottom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 05:46:47 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/if-you-want-to-build-a-treehouse-start-at-the-bottom/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever watched a kid draw a treehouse, you have some idea of how applications are built when security isn&amp;rsquo;t made a priority. It&amp;rsquo;s far more fun to draw the tire swing, front porch, and swimming pool than to worry about how a ten-thousand-gallon bucket of water stays suspended in midair. With too much attention spent on fun and flashy features, foundations suffer.
Of course, spending undue hours building a back end like Fort Knox may not be necessary for your application, either.</description></item><item><title>Secure web forms for the front-end developer</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/secure-web-forms-for-the-front-end-developer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:27:31 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/secure-web-forms-for-the-front-end-developer/</guid><description>While cybersecurity is often thought of in terms of databases and architecture, much of a strong security posture relies on elements in the domain of the front-end developer. For certain potentially devastating vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), a well-considered user interface is the first line of defense.
Here are a few areas of focus for front-end developers who want to help fight the good fight.
Control user input A whole whack of crazy things can happen when developers build a form that fails to control user input.</description></item><item><title>The care and feeding of an IoT device</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/the-care-and-feeding-of-an-iot-device/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:59:35 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/the-care-and-feeding-of-an-iot-device/</guid><description>Giving someone a puppy for Christmas might work really well in a movie, but in real life often comes hitched to a multitude of responsibilities that the giftee may not be fully prepared to take on. The same is true for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Alexa-enabled devices, Google Home, and other Internet-connected appliances like cameras, lightbulbs, and toasters. Yes, they have those now.
Like puppies, IoT devices are still young.</description></item><item><title>A cron job that could save you from a ransomware attack</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/a-cron-job-that-could-save-you-from-a-ransomware-attack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2019 08:27:31 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/a-cron-job-that-could-save-you-from-a-ransomware-attack/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2019, and ransomware has become a thing.
Systems that interact with the public, like companies, educational institutions, and public services, are most susceptible. While delivery methods for ransomware vary from the physical realm to communication via social sites and email, all methods only require one person to make one mistake in order for ransomware to proliferate.
Ransomware, as you may have heard, is a malicious program that encrypts your files, rendering them unreadable and useless to you.</description></item><item><title>Personal cybersecurity posture with too many pop culture references</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/personal-cybersecurity-posture-with-too-many-pop-culture-references/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 08:30:12 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/personal-cybersecurity-posture-with-too-many-pop-culture-references/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Zaphod&amp;rsquo;s just this guy, you know?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ndash; Halfrunt, Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. The book, not the movie. Definitely not the movie.
Some people (üôãüèª‚Äç) are really into cybersecurity, end-to-end encryption, and totally geeked out when they first learned how the Enigma worked. These people are likely to have an innate interest in building a less-than-laughable personal cybersecurity posture.
Most people, unfortunately, consider cybersecurity optional. Most people say things like:</description></item><item><title>Secure application architecture basics: separation, configuration, and access</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/secure-application-architecture-basics-separation-configuration-and-access/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 08:03:12 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/secure-application-architecture-basics-separation-configuration-and-access/</guid><description>Software developers today are encouraged to focus on building, and that&amp;rsquo;s a great thing. We&amp;rsquo;re benefitting from maker culture, an attitude of &amp;ldquo;always be shipping,&amp;rdquo; open source collaboration, and a bevy of apps that help us prioritize and execute with maximum efficiency. We&amp;rsquo;re in an environment of constant creation, where both teams and solo entrepreneurs can be maximally productive.
Sometimes, this breakneck-speed productivity shows its downsides.
As I learn more about security best practices, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but see more and more applications that just don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue.</description></item><item><title>How users and applications stay safe on the Internet: it's proxy servers all the way down</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-users-and-applications-stay-safe-on-the-internet-its-proxy-servers-all-the-way-down/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 09:35:28 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-users-and-applications-stay-safe-on-the-internet-its-proxy-servers-all-the-way-down/</guid><description>Both Internet users and Internet-connected applications can benefit from investing in cybersecurity. One core aspect of online privacy is the use of a proxy server, though this basic building block may not be initially visible underneath its more recognizable forms. Proxy servers are a useful thing to know about nowadays, for developers, software product owners, as well as the average dog on the Internet. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what makes proxy servers an important piece of cybersecurity support.</description></item><item><title>Hackers are Googling your plain text passwords: preventing sensitive data exposure</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/hackers-are-googling-your-plain-text-passwords-preventing-sensitive-data-exposure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 09:10:11 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/hackers-are-googling-your-plain-text-passwords-preventing-sensitive-data-exposure/</guid><description>Last week, I wrote about the importance of properly handling user input in our websites and applications. I alluded to an overarching security lesson that I hope to make explicit today: the security of our software, application, and customer data is built from the ground up, long before the product goes live.
The OWASP Top 10 is a comprehensive guide to web application security risks. It is relied upon by technology professionals, corporations, and those interested in cybersecurity or information security.</description></item><item><title>SQL injection and XSS: what white hat hackers know about trusting user input</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/sql-injection-and-xss-what-white-hat-hackers-know-about-trusting-user-input/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2019 09:01:23 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/sql-injection-and-xss-what-white-hat-hackers-know-about-trusting-user-input/</guid><description>Software developers have a lot on their minds. There are are myriad of questions to ask when it comes to creating a website or application: What technologies will we use? How will the architecture be set up? What functions do we need? What will the UI look like? Especially in a software market where shipping new apps seems more like a race for reputation than a well-considered process, one of the most important questions often falls to the bottom of the &amp;ldquo;Urgent&amp;rdquo; column: how will our product be secured?</description></item></channel></rss>
