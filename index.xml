Signal had so many new users sign up that it overwhelmed their existing infrastructure and lead to a 24-hour-ish outage. The small team responded impressively quickly, especially given that a 4,200% spike in new users was utterly implausible before it ocurred.</description></item><item><title>Create a self-hosted chat service with your own Matrix server</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/create-a-self-hosted-chat-service-with-your-own-matrix-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 01:38:07 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/create-a-self-hosted-chat-service-with-your-own-matrix-server/</guid><description>Matrix is an open standard for decentralized real-time communication. The specification is production-ready and bridges to tons of silo products like Slack, Gitter, Telegram, Discord, and even Facebook Messenger. This lets you use Matrix to link together disjoint communities in one place, or create an alternative communication method that works with, but is independent of, communication silos.
You can create your own self-hosted Matrix chat for as little as $3.50 USD per month on an AWS Lightsail instance.</description></item><item><title>Do I raise or return errors in Python?</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/do-i-raise-or-return-errors-in-python/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 05:34:48 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/do-i-raise-or-return-errors-in-python/</guid><description>I hear this question a lot: &amp;ldquo;Do I raise or return this error in Python?&amp;rdquo;
This is probably because the right answer will depend on your situation and the goals of your application logic. Either choice can help you ensure your Python code doesn&amp;rsquo;t fail silently, saving you and your teammates from having to hunt down deeply entrenched errors.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the difference between raise and return when handling failures in Python, and how to ensure your code doesn&amp;rsquo;t fail silently.</description></item><item><title>What tech leaders do before going on vacation</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/what-tech-leaders-do-before-going-on-vacation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 04:02:54 -0600</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/what-tech-leaders-do-before-going-on-vacation/</guid><description>As a technical person who leads a technical team, I know firsthand that it can be easy to get lost in finishing up your own work before a vacation.

The beauty of not completely knowing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing is a lack of premature judgement. Without a standard to rise to, you&amp;rsquo;re free to go sideways. Explore. Try things that don&amp;rsquo;t work, without any expectation they will work.

Instead of degrees and pre-requisites when it comes to deciding whether you&amp;rsquo;re qualified to be hired as a software developer, companies (including my own) are far more concerned with just one question.</description></item><item><title>a7051260-cff3-426c-bc90-7701469703a8</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/a7051260-cff3-426c-bc90-7701469703a8/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 06:44:01 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/a7051260-cff3-426c-bc90-7701469703a8/</guid><description>When choosing your new product name, you can save yourself a lot of grief by asking, &amp;ldquo;What would this sound like if someone verbed it?&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>08c89b39-ee40-43ef-a9fd-5035bba76bb9</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/08c89b39-ee40-43ef-a9fd-5035bba76bb9/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 07:46:44 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/08c89b39-ee40-43ef-a9fd-5035bba76bb9/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to turn on GitHub Pages for a Hugo theme repository, the configuration files in your theme might make GitHub Pages (Jekyll, really) confused.

This skill was instrumental to the creation of the Internet. If no one had imagined the underlying technology that most now take for granted every day, there would be no cat memes.
To make the Internet possible, two things that needed imagining are layers and protocols. Layers are conceptual divides that group similar functions together.</description></item><item><title>33342</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/33342/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/33342/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you found the secret room. 🎉

A set of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules entitled &amp;ldquo;Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services&amp;rdquo; were unfortunately struck down in 2017.

Mt. Fuji is, some folks would say, the cakewalk of mountain climbing.

For spiritual reasons, some Japanese folks make the climb at ages upwards of 80 years. There are huts to stop at along the way where you can rent a sleeping bag inside, and buy food and water.</description></item><item><title>20954</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/20954/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 13:26:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/20954/</guid><description>Do not fail silent into that good night.

In a suspenseful twisting epic, a young enterprising female detective would solve the mystery of a lost crystal of unfathomable monetary worth and historical significance.</description></item><item><title>19427</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/19427/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 15:55:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/19427/</guid><description>Faker and fixtures are my favorite f-words.</description></item><item><title>19137</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/19137/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 14:26:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/19137/</guid><description>I can hardly imagine a more relaxing start to a development workday than typing make start.</description></item><item><title>Writing efficient Django</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/writing-efficient-django/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 04:02:47 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/writing-efficient-django/</guid><description>I like Django. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-considered and intuitive framework with a name I can pronounce out loud. You can use it to to quickly spin up a weekend-sized project, and you can still use it to run full-blown production applications at scale. I&amp;rsquo;ve done both these things, and over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered how to use some of Django&amp;rsquo;s features for maximum efficiency. These are:

It&amp;rsquo;s far more fun to draw the tire swing, front porch, and swimming pool than to worry about how a ten-thousand-gallon bucket of water stays suspended in midair. With too much attention spent on fun and flashy features, foundations suffer.
Of course, spending undue hours building a back end like Fort Knox may not be necessary for your application, either.</description></item><item><title>13032</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/13032/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 15:02:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/13032/</guid><description>New workstation upgrade!</description></item><item><title>12747</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/12747/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 09:28:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/12747/</guid><description>“Your best and wisest refuge from all troubles is in your science” -Ada Lovelace</description></item><item><title>12558</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/12558/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 13:28:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/12558/</guid><description>If you love playing #AnimalCrossingNewHorizons, you’ll love a career of refactoring legacy code bases.

In typical developer rationality, there was clearly only one option. I decided to create the same theme in both frameworks, and to give you, dear reader, a side-by-side comparison.

When humans are busy and under stress, we tend to get lax in less-obviously-pressing areas, like the integrity of our online accounts. These areas only become an obvious problem when it&amp;rsquo;s too late for prevention.
Cybersecurity can be fiddly and time-consuming. You might need to reset forgotten passwords, transfer multifactor authentication (MFA) codes to different devices, or deal with the fallout of compromised payment details in the event one of your accounts is still breached.</description></item><item><title>3915</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/3915/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 15:55:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/3915/</guid><description>Of course, the elephant in the room is that we’ve all had the “Happy Birthday” song stuck in our heads for a month.</description></item><item><title>3852</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/3852/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 15:02:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/3852/</guid><description>Weekend to-dos:

SQLite (&amp;ldquo;see-quell-lite&amp;rdquo;) is a lightweight Sequel, or Structured Query Language (SQL), database engine. Instead of using the client-server database management system model, SQLite is self-contained in a single file. It is library, database, and data, all in one package.
For certain applications, SQLite is a solid choice for a production database. It&amp;rsquo;s lightweight, ultra-portable, and has no external dependencies.

Instead of opening an issue with a large scope like, &amp;ldquo;Fix all the broken links in the documentation,&amp;rdquo; open source projects will have more luck attracting contributors with several smaller and more manageable issues.

Both a sophisticated social engineering attack or grammatically-lacking email phishing scam can cause real damage. No one who communicates over the Internet is immune.
Like proper hand washing and getting a flu shot, good habits can lower your risk of inadvertently allowing cybergerms to spread. Since the new year is an inspiring time for beginning new habits, I offer a few suggestions for ways to help protect yourself and those around you.</description></item><item><title>Concurrency, parallelism, and the many threads of Santa Claus 🎅</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/concurrency-parallelism-and-the-many-threads-of-santa-claus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 19:29:01 -0500</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/concurrency-parallelism-and-the-many-threads-of-santa-claus/</guid><description>Consider the following: Santa brings toys to all the good girls and boys.

For certain potentially devastating vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), a well-considered user interface is the first line of defense.
Here are a few areas of focus for front-end developers who want to help fight the good fight.

The data recorded as issues, pull requests, and comments, become vital to understanding the project.
With the general availability of GitHub Actions, we have a chance to programmatically access and preserve GitHub event data in our repository. Making the data part of the repository itself is a way of preserving it outside of GitHub, and also gives us the ability to feature the data on a front-facing website, such as with GitHub Pages, through an automated process that&amp;rsquo;s part of our CI/CD pipeline.</description></item><item><title>30544</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/30544/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:16:22 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/30544/</guid><description>Halloween walks into a room full of hackers.

We&amp;rsquo;re benefitting from maker culture, an attitude of &amp;ldquo;always be shipping,&amp;rdquo; open source collaboration, and a bevy of apps that help us prioritize and execute with maximum efficiency. We&amp;rsquo;re in an environment of constant creation, where both teams and solo entrepreneurs can be maximally productive.
Sometimes, this breakneck-speed productivity shows its downsides.
As I learn more about security best practices, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but see more and more applications that just don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue.</description></item><item><title>26934</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/26934/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 19:22:33 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/26934/</guid><description>‪My new website is up, and one of my favourite parts isn&amp;rsquo;t even prominent.

One core aspect of online privacy is the use of a proxy server, though this basic building block may not be initially visible underneath its more recognizable forms.

Along with a static site generator like Hugo, keeping a blog up to date is pretty painless.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used Hugo to build my site for years, but until this past week I&amp;rsquo;d never hooked up my Pages repository to any deployment service. Why? Because using a tool that built my site before deploying it seemed to require having the whole recipe in one place - and if you&amp;rsquo;re using GitHub Pages with the free version of GitHub, that place is public.</description></item><item><title>09708</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/09708/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 13:39:20 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/09708/</guid><description>I sometimes see birds walking and think they must not be very excited about wherever it is they&amp;rsquo;re going.</description></item><item><title>09507</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/09507/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 14:50:38 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/09507/</guid><description>RT if you also have a git branch named &amp;ldquo;0v&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>08806</title><link>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/08806/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 13:39:20 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/neofeed/08806/</guid><description>What I really want out of face-recognition technology is software that blanks my screen if it detects a face other than my own looking at it.

Think of it as having a superpower that allows you to know exactly what type of program might be the most efficient in a particular situation - before even running a single line of code.
The fundamental concepts of complexity analysis are well worth studying. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to better understand how the code you&amp;rsquo;re writing will interact with the program&amp;rsquo;s input, and as a result, you&amp;rsquo;ll spend a lot less wasted time writing slow and problematic code.</description></item><item><title>Knapsack problem algorithms for my real-life carry-on knapsack</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/knapsack-problem-algorithms-for-my-real-life-carry-on-knapsack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2018 21:00:35 -0400</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/knapsack-problem-algorithms-for-my-real-life-carry-on-knapsack/</guid><description>The knapsack problem I&amp;rsquo;m a nomad and live out of one carry-on bag.

Among other things, this change has taught me about the benefits of using basic tools and running a minimal, lightweight system. You can achieve a lot of functionality with just command line tools and simple utilities. One example I&amp;rsquo;d like to illustrate in this post is setting up desktop notifications.</description></item><item><title>How a lifelong Windows user switched to Linux... the hard way</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-a-lifelong-windows-user-switched-to-linux...-the-hard-way/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:23:59 +0700</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-a-lifelong-windows-user-switched-to-linux...-the-hard-way/</guid><description>Let me preface this by saying that I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in finding out how things work. If a thing does something, I want to know why, how, and if I can customize it.
It should come as no surprise that Windows 10 drove me crazy.
Seemingly arbitrary updates that made for a long start-up process on any given day, surprise restarts that meant I&amp;rsquo;d lose my session and thus my thought process from the day before, and the worst part was I never knew what purpose they served.</description></item><item><title>How I ditched WordPress and set up my custom domain HTTPS site for (almost) free</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-i-ditched-wordpress-and-set-up-my-custom-domain-https-site-for-almost-free/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2017 13:16:17 +0700</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/how-i-ditched-wordpress-and-set-up-my-custom-domain-https-site-for-almost-free/</guid><description>I got annoyed with WordPress.com. While using the service has its pros (like https and a mobile responsive website, and being very visual and beginner-friendly) it&amp;rsquo;s limiting. For someone who&amp;rsquo;s comfortable enough to be tweaking CSS but who&amp;rsquo;s not interested in creating their own theme (or paying upwards of $50 for one), I felt I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really the type of consumer WordPress.com was suited to.
To start with, if you want to remove WordPress advertising and use a custom domain name, it&amp;rsquo;s a minimum of $3 per month.</description></item><item><title>Iteration in Python: for, list, and map</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/iteration-in-python-for-list-and-map/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2017 21:58:28 +0700</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/iteration-in-python-for-list-and-map/</guid><description>Iteration in Python can be a little hard to understand. Subtle differences in terminology like iteration, iterator, iterating, and iterable aren&amp;rsquo;t the most beginner-friendly.
When tackling new concepts, I find concrete examples to be most useful. I&amp;rsquo;ll share some in this post and discuss appropriate situations for each. (Pun intended.)
For loop First, in pseudocode:
for iterating_variable in iterable: statement(s) I find for loops to be the most readable way to iterate in Python.</description></item><item><title>The basics of streaming with Twitter API</title><link>https://victoria.dev/blog/the-basics-of-streaming-with-twitter-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2017 16:39:29 +0700</pubDate><author>hello@victoria.dev (Victoria Drake)</author><guid>https://victoria.dev/blog/the-basics-of-streaming-with-twitter-api/</guid><description>Twitter has begun asking users to apply to use the API, presumably to cut down on unpalatable uses.
