As a leader I empower team members through mentoring and mission command: communicating intent, offering guidance, and providing resources, then trusting execution to my team.</p><p>In roles as a business leader, developer, and programming mentor, I&rsquo;ve accumulated expertise in all aspects of building and shipping technology products. I&rsquo;m comfortable advising senior leaders on security and software best practices. I enjoy brainstorming a product road map with project managers, architects, and designers. I&rsquo;m also happy to do a technical deep-dive with other developers to debug an elusive multithreading issue &ndash; as long as there&rsquo;s coffee. I love to work remotely with highly-collaborative teams composed of people with complimentary skills.</p><p>I am a co-author and core maintainer for the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Web Security Testing Guide, widely considered to be the foremost open source resource for web application security testing.
